The bulk of my work on the Brian simulator is contained in a single pull request, to be found <a href="https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pull/870" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
In addition to this, I did a few pull requests that changed parts of Brian that did not only have to do with GSL integration (all really small changes):
<ul>
<li>Move <code class="code">get_default_code_object</code> functionality so it's device specific, so that the <code class="code">code_object_class</code> for the cpp_standalone device can also receive custom codeobjects. (<a href="https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pull/865/files/0064932e83ffc31ce09c06419204a68fcdc08f99" target="_blank">Pull Request</a>, status: merged)</li>
<li>Really small change in naming of the support code key that is sent to the jinja2 template. (<a href="https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pull/859/files/dee2929e152450eb254105dfc5f503fc08436332" target="_blank">Pull Request</a>, status: merged)</li>
<li>Add a method_options keyword to the initialization of <code class="code">NeuronGroup</code>, <code class="code">Synapses</code> and <code class="code">SpatialNeuron</code>, and have the options sent to the <code class="code">StateUpdater</code> and <code class="code">CodeGenerator</code>. Pull request needs to be updated to latest version before being ready for merge. (<a href="https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pull/858" target="_blank">Pull Reqest</a>, status: open)</li>

Project description (short)
</bold>
</h3>
<p class="entrytext">
In this Google Summer of Code project I implemented the option to carry out the numerical integration part in the <a href="http://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Brian simulator</a> with integrators defined in the odeiv2 module that comes with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Ordinary-Differential-Equations.html" target="_blank">GNU Scientific Library</a>. In addition to offering a few extra integration methods, the GSL integrator comes with the option of having an adaptable timestep. The latter functionality has major benefits for the speed with which large simulations in Brian can be run. This is because it allows the use of larger timesteps for the overhead loops in Python, without losing the accuracy of the numerical integration at points where small timesteps are necessary. I had personally used Brian before this project, and can tell from experience that this functionality can be very useful at times - especially when working with Hodgkin-Huxley-type equations. I think this speed-up could be an important factor for people to choose to use Brian for their simulations.

<p class="entrytext">
In addition to a choice between different integration methods, there is a few more
options that can be specified when using GSL. These options can be specified by
sending a dictionary as the method_options key upon initialization of the object
using the integrator (<Code cLass="code"><b>NeuronGroup</b></code>, <Code class="code"><b>Synapses</b></code> or <Code clAss="code"><b>SpatialNeuron</b></code>).
The available method options are:

<ul>
<li> <code class="code">adaptable_timestep</code>: whether or not to let GSL reduce the timestep to
  achieve the accuracy defined with the <code class="code">absolute_error</code> and
  <code class="code">absolute_error_per_variable</code> options described below. If this is set to False,
  the timestep defined under the option <code class="code">dt_start</code> is used. If the resulted
  estimated error exceeds the set error bounds, the simulation is aborted. When using
  cython or weave this is reported with an <Code class="code"><b>IntegrationError</b></code>.
  Defaults to True.
</li><li> <code class="code">dt_start</code>: what timestep to use as default. In the case that <code class="code">adaptable_timestep</code>
  is set to False, this is the timestep used for each integration step. Otherwise, it
  is given to the GSL ODE solver as an initial guess of what would be a good time step.
  if <code class="code">use_last_timestep</code> is set to True, this only affects the time step suggested
  at the very start. Otherwise, this is the suggested timestep for each Brian time step.
  Defaults to the dt set for the object using the integrator.
</li><li> <code class="code">absolute_error</code>: each of the methods has a way of estimating the error that
  is the result of using numerical integration. You can specify the maximum size of this
  error to be allowed for any of the to-be-integrated variables in base units with this
  keyword. Note that giving very small values makes the simulation slow and might result
  in unsuccessful integration. In the case of using the <code class="code">absolute_error_per_variable</code>
  option, this is the error for variables that were not specified individually.
  Defaults to 1e-6.
</li><li> <code class="code">absolute_error_per_variable</code>: specify the absolute error per variable in its own
  units. Variables for which the error is not specified use the error set with the
  <code class="code">absolute_error</code> option.
  Defaults to None.
</li><li> <code class="code">use_last_timestep</code>: with the <code class="code">adaptable_timestep</code> option set to True, GSL tries
  different time steps to find a solution that satisfies the set error bounds.
  It is likely that for Brian's next time step the GSL time step
  will be somewhat similar per neuron (e.g. active neurons will have a shorter GSL time step
  than inactive neurons). With this option set to True, the time step GSL found to satisfy
  the set error bounds is saved per neuron and given to GSL again in Brian's next time step.
  This also means that the final time steps are saved in Brian's memory and can thus
  be recorded with the <Code Class="code"><b>StateMonitor</b></code>: it can be accessed under <code class="code">_last_timestep</code>.
  Note that some extra memory is required to keep track of the last time steps.
  Defauls to True.
</li><li> <code class="code">save_failed_steps</code>: if <code class="code">adaptable_timestep</code> is set to True,
  each time GSL tries a time step and it results in an estimated
  error that exceeds the set bounds, one is added to the <code class="code">_failed_steps</code> variable. For
  purposes of investigating what happens within GSL during an integration step, we offer
  the optionality of saving this variable.
  Defaults to False.
</li><li> <code class="code">save_step_count</code>: the same goes for the total number of GSL steps taken in a single
  Brian time step: this is optionally saved in the <code class="code">_step_count</code> variable.
  Defaults to False.
</li>
</ul>

Note that at the moment recording <code class="code">_last_timestep</code>, <code class="code">_failed_steps</code>, or <code class="code">_step_count</code>
requires a call to <code class="code"><b>run</b></code> (e.g. with 0 ms) to trigger the code generation process, before the
call to <Code Class="code"><b>StateMonitor</b></code>.

Illustration of benefits from variable timestep
</bold>
</h3>
<p class="entrytext">
In addition to offering several integration algorithms that are not yet offered in Brian (see first section), one of the biggest advantages of supporting the GSL ODE solvers is that they integrate with variable timesteps. This could be especially advantageous in situations where neurons/synapses are silent for long periods of time, but for which the time constants of state variables can suddenly be of submillisecond order. An example would be a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with low average spiking rates: at any point in time only a small subset of state variables require high precision integration. However, every time a neuron spikes its dynamics become very fast, requiring integration with timesteps in the order of microseconds. 
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
As an illustration of this benefit when having some neurons with long time constants and others with short ones consider a group of a hundred neurons that can be described by the following equation:
<br/><code class="code">
dv/dt = (-v + s)/tau
</code><br/>
where s and tau are set every 10 ms according to:
<br/><code class="code">
s = rand()
<br/>
tau = .01*ms + rand()*10*ms
</code><br/>
resulting in 'neurons' with time constants ranging from .01 to 10.1 ms. Now, what are the sizes of the timesteps that need to be taken in order to achieve comparable accuracy between GSL and the conventional Brian? And what is its effect on the overall simulation time?
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
To achieve an accuracy so that the difference between the analytic solution and the numerical integration never exceeds <b>1e-3 volt</b> (1 mV), using rk2: <br/>
On average, the GSL integrator takes <b class="code">1.4 steps/ms</b> and the resulting average error is 3.9e-5 volt (requiring .24 seconds/simulated second). I set the overhead timestep to 1 ms in this case. <br/>
I looped over the simulation in the case of conventional brian, and if the maximum error exceeded 1 mV I halved the timestep and ran everything again. The dt that resulted the simulation to pass was 15.625 microseconds, equivalent to <b class="code">64 steps/ms</b>. The resulting average error is 3.7e-7 volt (requiring 1.23 second/simulated second). <br/>
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
If I repeat this test for an accuracy of <b>1e-6 volt</b> then: <br/>
GSL does <b class="code">7.7 steps/ms</b> on average for a simulation time of 1 seconds in <b class="code">.29 seconds</b>, while without adaptable timestep reaching this accuracy requires the whole simulation to be run with <b class="code">512 steps/ms</b> taking <b class="code">9.89 seconds</b>.
