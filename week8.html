<h3><bold>
Writing tests
</bold></h3>
<p class="entrytext">
I heard to control your code you should have unit tests that test only small parts of your code. I find it hard to come up with such tests for Brian, unless we would in some way hardcode certain output (such as manually written abstract code?) and check against this. 
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
Instead, I have rewritten the example files I was using to test weather my code was working as expected, and came up with a few tests that would fail in a few scenarios I could come up with.
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
The first test, <code class="code">test_GSL_statepdater_basic()</code>, is an adaptation of the adaptive_treshold example. I want to run this example for the linear stateupdater already existing in Brian and for all my target languages, to confirm that the output for a basic simulation is the same in all these situations. The Poisson input required by the simulation I replace with pre-defined spiketimes so I can easily give the same input on every iteration. Since I want to draw random numbers without checking whether there is double spiking within one timestep - something that SpikeGeneratorGroup neurons are not allowed to do in Brian - I made a separate unit per spike: I'm only running the simulation for 100 ms so to achieve the originally set input of 500 Hz there is 50 spikes. The tests: there should be more than 0 spikes (something should happen) and the number of spikes should agree between all targets.
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
In the next two tests I adapt the phase_locking example to test whether the default and user defined functions work without issue. In addition to the basic test whether the code generation process runs without raising exceptions or compilation errors I check 3 things:
<ul>
<li>
The Brian trace is not exactly the same as the GSL traces: they are both using a different integration method and GSL is integrating with an adaptable timestep. If both traces are exactly the same there is likely something wrong (for example, nothing happens and they are both 0!)
</li>
<li>
The difference between the Brian trace and the GSL traces cannot exceed .1 mV: we want the output to be approximately the same. This assertion could fail if the GSL update does not do anything (output is 0 0 0 0, while Brian output is not 0 0 0 0 otherwise previous assertion would have failed), or the integration just spits out wrong values (assuming Brian is doing the right thing).
</li>
<li>
The GSL targets produce the exact same output: nothing should change about the integration whether we're using Cython, Weave or C++ standalone mode.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
The next test is just to check whether compilation occurs successfully when setting the NeuronGroup's dt different to default. This is just to test the changes I made to use the dt and t that Brian wants to use for integration (before I hardcoded e.g. t = _array_defaultclock_t[0] also see section below). Other than testing for successful compilation this test doesn't do anything.
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
The last test I designed does not pass (yet?)... I wanted to check whether Brian and GSL returned the exact same results if they were set to use the same integration method and GSL's adaptable timestep function was turned off. Basically this is not the case. Even stranger, the error between Brian and C++ standalone is over tenfold bigger than the error betwen Brian and Cython or Weave. This, while for earlier tests the results obtained with Cython Weave and C++ standalone were exactly the same.. I'll have to investigate this output a bit more to find out what is going on. Log on this (all add to this until solved):

<h3><bold>
Pull requests for method_options and support_code_lines
</bold></h3>
<p class="entrytext">
Made separate branch for both of these issues and just manually copied the changes I made in the GSL branch to achieve these things (see week 7 for more details). Still TODO: add method_options to synapses and spatial neuron. Also, I haven't actually figured out how to run the test suite from Brian. It seems to be failing and I first thought this wasn't my fault (Marcel said something about the test suite failing with the new update of sympy), but maybe it is?

<p class="entrytext">
A few files in the compartmental examples folder don't run at all. The message I get is the following:

this applies to bipolar_cell.py, bipolar_with_inputs.py, cylinder.py, infinite_cable.py, lfp.py and rall.py. I haven't really looked into whether the reason for this is obvious. Maybe Marcel knows?

<p class="entrytext">
All the other files (hh_with_spikes.py, hodgkin_huxley_1952.py, bipolar_with_inputs2.py and spike_initiation), though, seem to work with setting the method to 'GSL_stateupdater' without a problem. I ran in only one minor issue trying this out, and that was that I set the 'adaptable_timestep' option of the GSL integrator to False on default, and with the default epsilon values the errors were too large when running hodgkin_huxley_1952 resulting in an integration error. Changing these default settings got rid of the integration error (also nice test of the catching of an integration error!)

_array_neurongroup_1_clock_t etc.
</bold></h3>
<p class="entrytext">
So before I was accessing the t and dt that I needed in the GSL template by hardcoding the pulling out of the variable from the arrays (i.e. <code class="code">dt = _array_defaultclock_dt[0]</code> in the 'scalar' bit and <code class="code">t = _array_defaultclock_t[0]</code> in the vector loop (in vector because GSL changes t so we have to re-set it before every integration)). This only works if the dt used in the NeuronGroup matches that of the default clock. However, if we change the dt of the NeuronGroup, the statements give a namespace error, and the dt we are trying to access is not the one meant for the Neurongroup. Thus, we need to make this bit of template dynamic and dependent on the actual dt used for the NeuronGroup.
I achieved this by adding the following to the <code class="code">GSL_generator.translate</code> method:
<pre><code class="code">
kwds['t_array'] = self.get_array_name(self.variables['t']) + '[0]'
kwds['dt_array'] = self.get_array_name(self.variables['dt']) + '[0]'
</code></pre>
and changing the setting of the t and dt in the template to:
<pre><code class="code">
dt = {{dt_array}}
t = {{t_array}}
</code></pre>

set needed_variables = ['t', 'dt'] at GSL-specific location
</bold></h3>
<p class="entrytext">
Before I was calling CodeRunner in the StateUpdater class initiated from the initialization of NeuronGroup with needed_variables=['t', 'dt']. However, CodeRunner will also be called like this when StateUpdateMethods do not need these variables. It was on my TO DO list to change the code to only set these needed variables when using the GSL StateUpdateMethod.
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
Since we are already transferring the GSL CodeObject from StateUpdateMethod to StateUpdater in the metod called <a href="https://github.com/CharleeSF/brian2/blob/81594638d65fdcfbe4a9eb1a985817c8da088dfe/brian2/groups/neurongroup.py#L184" target="_blank">here</a>, with a <a href="https://github.com/CharleeSF/brian2/commit/270795a7474e99dfc79f38a2f02c09eedfb78f08#diff-9ecaef55844605513fd910a2eea2dd88R36" target="_blank">function</a> defined in the GSL specific code, I figured this was a good location to also add the needed_variables to the already existing needed_variables list.

<h3><bold>
(unless refractory) tag
</bold></h3>
<p class="entrytext">
For one of the tests I used an example that uses the (unless refractory) tag for the description of the system. Using this, I found out it fails for C++ based code. The reason is that, whereas without the tag the code generated by the cpp_generator looks like this:
<pre><code class="code">
const double _gsl_v_f0 = expression;
</code></pre>
However, when this is conditional to the cell being in refractory state, the code looks something like this:
<pre><code class="code">
double _gsl_v_f0;
if not_refractory:
	_gsl_v_f0 = expression;
else:
	_gsl_v_f0 = 0.0;
</code></pre>
Since my method of re-writing the original C++ code by replacing <code class="code">'const double _gsl_v_f0'</code> with <code class="code">'f[0]'</code>, just _gsl_v_f0 is not replaced. 
</p>
<p class="entrytext">
Although I could just add multiple options to the to_replace dictionary to catch all possibilities, I figured it would be nicer to actually have GSL_generator deal with flags specifically. Especially, since I am expecting that I will have to add some functionality to deal with other tags as well. This means that we have to send the flags to the generator from a place where they are known. For now I decided to add the flags to a dictionary in the StateUpdateMethod and send them to the generator in the CodeObject that was already sent from StateUpdateMethod to generator. I'm not sure if I like this solution, though. I might have to look at a more elegant solution and investigate how exactly Brian deals with the flags. <a href="https://github.com/CharleeSF/brian2/commit/0683f89747eefc3fd15082cb60b564b63b706cc0" target="_blank">This</a> is the relevant commit.
